# DXF library

Library of DXF parts.

## Notes

Note that not all dimensions are guaranteed to be accurate, always double check
before manufacture.

Pin labels usually list special functions first and disregard generic functions
(e.g. Raspberry Pi pin 3 is labelled as SDA, not GPIO 0/2).

## Credits

- Raspberry Pi main board was adapted from DXF found
